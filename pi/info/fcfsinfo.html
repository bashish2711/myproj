<h3 class="w3-text-teal" id="fcfsinfo" > First Come First Serve </h3>
<p>
In the FCFS scheduling, tasks are implemented on first come, first serve basis. It can be a non-preemptive as well as preemptive scheduling algorithm based on the necessities.  Jobs are processed in the order that they arrive
</p>
<li class="w3-text-teal" ><b>Advantages</b></li>

<ol> Simple to schedule.
</ol><ol>Easy to implement; 
</ol><ol>Every process is executed hence no issue of starvation.
</ol><ol>No CPU overhead for schedling point calculations.
</ol>
<li class="w3-text-teal"> <b>Disadvantages </b></li>
<ol>No Option for priority and preemption and hence deadline miss may occure in case of deadline constarints. 
</ol><ol>CPU task waiting time becomes large when large process is executed.
