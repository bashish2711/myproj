<h3 class="w3-text-teal" id="H3" > Round-robin scheduling </h3>
<p>

Round-robin is an algorithm in which the operating system uses a timer, called quantum, where all processes gain the same amount of quantum to rotate in the CPU.
</p>
<li class="w3-text-teal" ><b>Advantages</b></li>

<ol> Simplicity; 
</ol><ol>Easy to implement; 
</ol><ol>Generates time slot for each process,making the process queue does not stand still in a single process.
</ol><ol>Each process gets equal CPU time so no process is served with priority, Hence fair scheduling.
</ol><ol>No problem of starvation.

</ol>
<li class="w3-text-teal" > <b>Disadvantages </b></li>
<ol> Diffcult to select the time quantum.
</ol><ol>If time quantum is large this becomes same as First Come First Serve Scheduling.
</ol><ol>If time quantum is small the context switching and hence the processor overhead is large.
