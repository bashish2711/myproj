<li class="w3-text-teal" ><b>Advantages</b></li>

<ol> Simplicity; 
</ol><ol>Priority based round robin has less number of context switches in comparison to simple round robin for same value of time quantum. 
</ol><ol>Generates time slot for each process,making the process queue does not stand still in a single process.
</ol><ol>Tasks may be prioritized.
</ol>
<li class="w3-text-teal" > <b>Disadvantages </b></li>
<ol> Problem of Starvation may occure.
