This is preemptive type of scheduling and criteria is based upon the burst time. The scheduling point is check each time a task is added. The task with least remaining burst time is given highest priority. Starvation is prevented but task switching is large in this type of scheduling.Jobs are prioritized by job burst duration but allowing for preemption by shorter, newly-arriving processes.
