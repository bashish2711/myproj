<p>
HRRN scheduling is a on-line and non-preemptive type of scheduling. Task priority in this algorithm is not only dependent on its estimated burst time, but also of its waiting time spent before execution. However, HRRN favors the short processes, but the long processes gain higher priority as they wait, which prevents process starvation.

<li class="w3-text-teal"><b>Advantages</b></li>

<ol>
</ol><ol>Large througput as small tasks are executed first. 
</ol><ol>Avoid starvation as waiting processes also get priority with escaped time.
</ol><ol> Less context switiching.
</ol>
<li class="w3-text-teal" > <b>Disadvantages </b></li>
<ol>Burst Time and waiting time calculations implies CPU overhead
</ol><ol>No preemption hence can not prioritized tasks.
