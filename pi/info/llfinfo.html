<h3 class="w3-text-teal" id="H3" > Least Laxity First </h3>
<p>
In the Least-Laxity-First (LLF) scheduling algorithm a task whose laxity or slack is the least is given highest priority. The laxity or slack is defined as the difference of the task deadline and the burst time. This algorithm has been proved to be optimal for a uni-processor system. It is preemptive type scheduling and is less predictive
</p>
<li class="w3-text-teal" ><b>Advantages</b></li>
<ol> It is theoretically better than EDF. 
</ol><ol>The starvation problem is not there.
</ol><ol> The slack can also be used to get a power aware policy.
</ol>
<li class="w3-text-teal" > <b>Disadvantages </b></li>
<ol> Large CPU overhead for additional computations.
</ol><ol> It can only work on current system state.
</ol><ol> Less optimal than Ealiest Deadline First.
</ol>
