<h3 class="w3-text-teal" id="H3" > Multilevel Feedback Queue Scheduling </h1>
<p>
Multiple queues is an algorithm in which processes queues are used. Each queue has a certain priority level, and the operating system initially meets the highest priority queues, then only when a queue is emptied the scheduler moves to the next one.

<li class="w3-text-teal"><b>Advantages</b></li>

<ol>
Increased CPU utilization; maximize throughput;.
</ol><ol> minimize turnaround;
</ol><ol>  minimize waiting time;  
</ol><ol>minimize response time; decreased use of resources; 
</ol><ol>prioritize processes that hold key resources; no system degradation
</ol>
<li class="w3-text-teal"> <b>Disadvantages </b></li>
<ol>Behavior difficult to predict; 
</ol><ol>processes changes queue.
